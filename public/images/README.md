# Images Directory

## Required Images

Place your images here for the application to work properly:

- `logo.png` - Application logo (32x32px recommended)
- `default-album.jpg` - Default album artwork (300x300px recommended)
- `album-midnight-reverie.jpg` - Hero album artwork (500x500px recommended)
- `album-1.jpg` to `album-6.jpg` - Song thumbnails (300x300px recommended)

## Placeholder System

The application uses automatic placeholders via `via.placeholder.com` if images are not found.
This means the app will work even without actual images.

## Adding Your Own Images

1. Add images to this directory
2. Use appropriate naming (as listed above)
3. Recommended formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
4. Optimize images for web (compress them before uploading)
